{"name":"Pspectralclustering","tagline":"A parallel C++ implementation of Parallel Spectral Clustering","body":"pspectralclustering is a parallel C++ implementation of Parallel Spectral Clustering.  We are expecting to present a highly optimized parallel implemention of all the steps of spectral clustering.  We use [PARPACK](http://www.caam.rice.edu/~kristyn/parpack_home.html) as underlying eigenvalue decomposition package and [F2C](http://www.netlib.org/f2c/) to compile fortran code.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to publish any work based on pspectralclustering, please cite our paper as:\r\n\r\nThe bibtex format is\r\n```\r\n@article{Chen11,^M\r\n  author = {Wen-Yen Chen and Yangqiu Song and Hongjie Bai and Chih-Jen Lin and Edward Y.
